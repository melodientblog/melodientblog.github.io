This post isn't finished yet but I'm going to test it on the blog anyway.

So it turns out that having a second child can seriously hamper one's attempts at starting a blog. Back at it now though so on to the main subject...

I don't like throwing things away. I managed to drop one of my trusty old JBL Creature satellite speakers a couple of weeks ago causing the magnet to shoot out through the front of the speaker. The driver itself was definitely toast so I looked around to see if you could get replacement parts.  There's a few videos on youtube such as this [one](https://youtu.be/Z3UJYr1iAbg) that show people fixing these speakers with small 5W units available on ebay. I found [this driver](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/264057406145?hash=item3d7b0c42c1:g:RrcAAOSwKgxebJar) on ebay and ordered a couple to try.
